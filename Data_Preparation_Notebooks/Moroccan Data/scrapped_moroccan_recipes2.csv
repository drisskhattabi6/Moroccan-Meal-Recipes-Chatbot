Pressure Cooker Moroccan Lamb or Beef Tagine With Prunes,"Beef or lamb with prunes is a classic sweet and savory Moroccan dish that combines dried prunes and meat with the fragrant spices of ginger, saffron, cinnamon, and pepper. It's popular as a traditional offering at holiday gatherings, weddings, and other special occasions.Of course, no special occasion is needed in order for a tagine of lamb with prunes to appear on the table. Prep work is minimal, making it a perfect choice for casual family meals. Although the use of a Moroccan clay or ceramic tagine is most traditional, most Moroccan cooks prepare this dish in a pressure cooker as it speeds things up. Tender cuts of meat (some pieces on the bone) will give the best results.The cooking time listed below is for the pressure cooker method.

Moroccan Chicken Tagine with Olives and Preserved Lemons,"A classic dish, this Moroccan chicken tagine gets tons of flavor from preserved lemons, olives, and onions. It can be cooked on the stovetop in an authentic tagine or roasted in a baking pan in the oven, depending on what equipment you have at your disposal. Either way, you'll enjoy a delicious meal that is sure to please everyone at the dinner table.To the unfamiliar, tagine can be a little confusing, because it's both the name of the dish, and the vessel in which the dish is cooked. Typically made of clay or ceramic, the tagine is used in northern African cuisine, and it is distinguished by its wide, circular base and a cone-shaped top.The tagine functions like a slow cooker in a sense: the cone shape returns moisture to the base of the tagine, creating a moist and flavorful dish. Traditionally, tagines sit on a bed of charcoal bricks specifically designed to retain their heat for hours. However, home cooks may find it more practical to put the tagine in a low oven or over low heat on the stovetop instead (this recipe uses the stovetop method).This recipe includes a number of traditional Moroccan ingredients. Here's a rundown of the ones that might be less familiar if you don't cook Moroccan food often.Moroccan tradition is to eat directly from the tagine, using Moroccan bread to scoop up the chicken and sauce. Belgian fries (patate frite) often top the chicken, though you can use your favorite French fry recipe or heat up packaged fries. Serving rice on the side also helps you soak up the tasty juices.The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck",5 hrs 10 mins,"['1 to 2\xa0preserved lemons, quartered and seeds removed', '1 whole chicken, cut into pieces, skin removed, back discarded or reserved for another use (or an equivalent mix of chicken parts)', '2 large white or yellow onions, finely chopped', '2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced', '1 small handful fresh cilantro, chopped', '1 small handful fresh parsley, chopped', '2 teaspoons ground ginger', '1 teaspoon black pepper', '1 teaspoon turmeric\xa0(or 1/4 teaspoon Moroccan yellow colorant)', '1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste', '1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled, optional', '1 teaspoon smen, optional', '1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ras el hanout, optional', '1/3 cup olive oil', '2 handfuls pitted\xa0olives\xa0(green, red, or\xa0mixed)', '1/4 cup water, approximately, if using a tagine']","{'Steps to Make It': ['Gather the ingredients.The Spruce Eats / Julia Hartbeck', 'Remove the flesh from the preserved lemons and chop the flesh finely.

Moroccan Chermoula Marinade,"Chermoula is a thick marinade for fish and the foundation of many Moroccan and North African fish dishes, such as fried sardines stuffed with chermoula and a fish tagine called mqualli made of layered potatoes, tomatoes, fish, and peppers. Although each country has its version of chermoula—and there are several variations—the taste is always very similar.In addition to fish, it can also be used to marinate chicken or shellfish; just add extra water to thin it out, leave the meat to marinate for up to a day, and grill or bake to your liking.This classic chermoula recipe, which is close to relish in texture, is quick and easy to prepare. Adjust the levels of spiciness depending on your preference.

"Moroccan Chicken Rfissa - Trid Pastry With Chicken, Lentils, and Fenugreek","There may be nothing elegant about pouring hot meat and broth over a plateful of bread, yet around the world such humble fare is regarded as savory, satisfying comfort food at its best. You'll find chicken and chickpeas, lamb and vegetables, and a number of soups served this way in Iraq, the United Arab Emerites, and Italy, respectively.Morocco has its own mouthwatering version: rfissa medhoussa, or trid, a wonderfully savory chicken, onion, and lentil dish that's served on a bed of shredded trid pastry, msemen, meloui, or even day-old bread. The blend of ras el hanout, fenugreek seeds (helba in Arabic), saffron, and other spices makes a truly unique and delicious dish. As such, it's traditionally served on the third day following the birth of a child or for other special occasions. Of course, it can be offered at other times as well, and it's a favorite to offer at casual company dinners.Organic, free-range chicken (djaj beldi) are preferred for this dish, but regular chickens may be used instead. You'll find the stew itself easy to make, while the traditional bed of trid or msemen is more time-consuming. Although that can be done concurrent with the stewing of the chicken, you may find it preferable to make the msemen a day or more in advance; once shredded, it can be frozen until needed and then reheated by steaming in a couscoussier.Cooking time is for a free-range chicken; reduce the time by half if using a regular chicken.

Moroccan Fish Tagine (Mqualli),"This is a recipe for a classic Moroccan fish mqualli tagine with potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers. Traditionally, the ingredients are layered in a tagine or deep skillet, then cooked over a fire or on the stove. In the north of Morocco, fish stews such as this one are prepared in tagras, round or oval clay casseroles similar to tagines, but without the conical top.Mqualli is a term which refers to sauces made with ginger, saffron, and oil. Here, however, the additional zesty flavor comes from fresh or preserved lemons, olives and a Moroccan marinade called chermoula.Any firm, thick fish can be used—cut up or whole—but slices of conger eel work best because there are fewer bones to deal with at the table.

Spicy Moroccan Rice with Tomatoes and Peppers,"While it's true that bread accompanies almost every Moroccan meal, khobz is not necessarily needed when the main dish is built around couscous or pasta or rice, all of which might be offered alone with no sides or bread at all.This saucy, spicy Moroccan rice recipe is one example.

A Spanish influence might indeed be at play here, as a number of regional Moroccan dishes can be linked to our northern neighbor.Here, the rice gets a little bit of kick from its blend of Moroccan spices which includes cayenne pepper, but if you really like things fiery throw a chili pepper into the pot while the rice is cooking. Conversely, omit the cayenne if you don't want any heat at all.I'm most inclined to offer the rice as stand-alone fare in the evening when a light supper suffices after a much heartier main meal at lunchtime.

Moroccan Vegetarian Carrot and Chickpea Tagine,"Tagines are usually the main dish in Morocco, but this vegetarian version works equally well as a side to meat or poultry.Chickpeas and carrots are stewed with piquant, aromatic seasonings including ginger, cinnamon, and the multi-spice know as ras el hanout.

Moroccan Berber Tagine With Lamb or Beef and Vegetables,"Moroccan tagines that combine meat and vegetables make wonderful one-dish meals to offer at family dinners or when entertaining casually. They can be slow-cooked on the stove, or prepped indoors and then cooked outside over charcoal for backyard dining or at beach outings and picnics.Berber style tagines such as this one are distinguished not only by the seasoning but also by the presentation of ingredients. The vegetables are carefully arranged in conical fashion around the beef or lamb, fully concealing the meat in an artistic, appetizing manner.Although many of the tagine recipes on this site include directions for alternative preparations in a pot or pressure cooker, this one is best slowly cooked in the traditional clay or ceramic vessel from which it takes its name. The seasoning below is ideal when using potatoes as the dominant ingredient, but other vegetables are added for color and complementary flavor. Here I'm recommending carrots and zucchini, but either or both can be replaced with fresh peas, green beans, sliced tomatoes, turnips, or other veggies you might have on hand.Preserved lemon and olives are classic additions and do add a distinctive flavor and some saltiness, but may be omitted if you don't have them on hand. Adjust salt accordingly. If using chicken instead of red meat, see the tips below.The tagine serves as both the cooking vessel and serving dish; diners gather around and eat from their own side of the tagine using Moroccan bread (khobz) in place of a utensil.",3 hrs 55 mins,"['1 pound beef, or lamb, cut into 2-inch to 3-inch pieces', '1/4 to 1/3 cup olive oil', '1 medium onion, sliced', '1 medium onion, finely chopped', '3 to 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or pressed', '3 to 4 small potatoes, or medium, quartered lengthwise', '3 to 4 medium carrots, halved or quartered lengthwise', '4 small zucchini, whole, or other veggies, optional', '1 small bell pepper, any color, cut into strips or rings', '1 small handful parsley, and/or cilantro sprigs, tied into a bouquet', '1 small jalapeño, or chile pepper, optional', '1 small preserved lemon, quartered', '1 handful\xa0olives, green or red/violet']","{'Steps to Make It': ['Pour the olive oil into the base of a tagine.', 'Arrange the onion rings across the bottom and scatter the\xa0chopped onion and garlic on top.', 'Arrange the meat, bone-side down, in a mound in the center of the tagine.

"Moroccan Lamb Tagine With Raisins, Almonds, and Honey","Mrouzia, sometimes spelled M'rouzia, is a sweet and spicy Moroccan tagine traditionally prepared in the days following the Islamic holiday of Eid Al Adha or Eid Al Kabir.

Vegetarian Moroccan Lentils Recipe,"For those who grew up with the notion that lentils belong in soups and salads and not much else, or for whom bean dishes in general just don't hold much appeal, this Moroccan dish will be a bit of a revelation.

Moroccan Kefta Tagine,"A favorite of children and adults alike, kefta mkaouara (or Mmawra) is a presentation of petite, cherry-sized meatballs in a zesty homemade tomato sauce. Traditionally this famous Moroccan dish is prepared in a tagine, which lends earthy flavor, but a deep, wide skillet or Dutch oven will work just fine. Eggs are often added to the dish at the end of cooking; they're allowed to poach just until the whites set.The well-seasoned meatballs are easy to make, but a set of extra hands will make shorter work of this step. Plan to start simmering the sauce while you shape with the kefta, which can be made from ground lamb, ground beef, or a combination of the two.

Moroccan Chicken and Onion Tagine Recipe With Djaj Beldi,"Chicken tagines such as this are common fare at casual restaurants throughout Morocco and very easy to recreate at home. They're extra delicious when prepared in a clay tagine, which imparts an earthy essence to the finished dish. Free range chickens (called djaj beldi in Morocco) are more highly regarded than factory-raised hens but plan ahead as they do take more time to cook.Although well-seasoned, this particular tagine is not spicy. You can increase the quantity of spices or add a chili pepper or two for a zestier presentation, but try not to overshadow the prized flavor of a free range bird. The onions, some of which caramelize during cooking, will add a subtle sweetness. A little preserved lemon and olives are optional additions.Try to cook like the average Moroccan by skipping measuring spoons and simply sprinkling the approximate quantity of spices over the chicken before cooking.

"Moroccan Okra, Zucchini and Tomato Tagine Recipe","Throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean, you'll encounter a variety of dishes which pair okra and tomatoes. In this Moroccan tagine recipe, zucchini is added to the mix, providing complementary flavor and an alternate vegetable for those who may not be wild about okra.Okra tagines are commonly prepared with beef or lamb; chicken may be used instead but you'll want to reduce the liquids and adjust cooking time accordingly. Many people prefer baby or young okra; if using larger, longer pods, you can cut them into small pieces but leaving the pods intact allows for nicer presentation and reduces the amount of mucilage released. The gelatinous mucilage acts as a natural thickening agent, but some find its consistency to be unpleasantly slimy. Soaking the okra in a water and vinegar bath helps reduce that effect.In Morocco, you'll hear okra referred to as . That term can be confusing, as elsewhere in the Arabic speaking world the same word is used to refer to a mallow-like green which also releases mucilage when cooked.Cooking time is for a pressure cooker. Allow double this time if cooking in a conventional pot and triple this time if slow cooking in a tagine.

Moroccan Style Hamburger Recipe,"Ground beef is rarely cooked without seasoning in Morocco, even when shaping kefta into large patties to serve as hamburgers. The addition of Moroccan spices and herbs to the meat helps transform a routine hamburger into a memorable meal. Grilling the meat will add even more flavor.The recipe below reflects my preference for reducing standard kefta seasoning by about half when serving hamburgers with American toppings on soft rolls.

"Moroccan Tuna Bocadillos With Olives, Potatoes and Harissa","The word bocadillo is undeniably Spanish, but Moroccans also use it to describe a hoagie-style sandwich which is sold as a street food and widely available in sandwich shops. Depending on the vendor, a Moroccan bocadillo might be prepared using half of a long French baguette, on an 8"" baguette roll, or with half of a loaf of Moroccan khobz. At home, any crusty sandwich bread or roll will do.Tuna, olives, eggs, raw onion, tomatoes and potatoes are common fillers, making it similar to a tuna nicoise sandwich but with extras. Combined with bread, that may seem like carbohydrate overload, but my kids love it. Although the bread is traditionally left dry, I like to brush it with olive oil; a vinaigrette or mayo may also be used. Harissa or hot sauce (sauce piquante) are typical condiments. Olive tapenade is also excellent for adding moisture and flavor.Use the list of ingredients below as inspiration for creating your signature sandwich which builds on a base of tuna, potatoes, and eggs. If serving the bocadillos as a family meal, it helps to plan ahead and have everything arranged in dishes on the table or counter so that you can move quickly while in assembly mode. It may seem like a bit of work to pull together so many ingredients for a cold sandwich –particularly if you need to take the time to steam or boil potatoes, cook some veggies and boil some eggs – but your family and stomach will thank you.Use your judgment for how much of each ingredient to use per person.

Moroccan Harira Soup,"​Harira is a classic Moroccan comfort soup made with tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, fresh herbs, dried spices, and meat, making it a filling and satisfying dish. Although served year-round, it is particularly popular for breaking the fast during Ramadan. It can be offered as an appetizer or main, depending on the serving size, and is usually served with lemon slices (or lemon juice), crusty bread, figs, and a honey-rosewater flavored pastry called chebakia.The Spruce Eats / Bahareh NiatiThere are many variations of harira, and recipes are often passed down from generation to generation. Some versions feature broken pieces of vermicelli and smen—a preserved butter with a Parmesan-like taste. Harira is typically made with chicken, lamb, or beef, but some variations of this recipe skip the meat to be vegetarian and vegan. Make it gluten-free by replacing the vermicelli with rice noodles and skipping the flour.For this recipe, we use a pressure cooker for a shorter cooking time; to adapt for simmering on the stove, follow the directions for the traditional stockpot method. To make it easier, soak the chickpeas and lentils overnight.Here are some helpful tips to reduce the prep time:Process the cilantro, parsley, and celery in a food processor or blender. Add the peeled and seeded tomatoes and blend until well pureed. Add the onion and process until the onion is reduced to small pieces. Add to the browned meat.If you plan to cook harira frequently, it’s helpful to prep large amounts of key ingredients in advance, like soaking, peeling, and then freezing chickpeas, or chopping an ample supply of parsley, cilantro, and celery, freezing them together in batch-sized amounts.
