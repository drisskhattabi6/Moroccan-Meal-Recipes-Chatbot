"Feqqas are deliciously crunchy and aromatic cookies that hold a special place in Moroccan traditions, often enjoyed alongside mint tea in the afternoon. These irresistible sweets undergo a unique baking process.

The dough is shaped into logs, baked once, and then covered with a clean, damp cloth overnight. The next day, the logs are sliced into bite-sized pieces and baked again. 

Made with a blend of flour, whole almonds, sesame seeds, and dried fruits, these treats offer a delightful combination of textures and flavors.

The multilevel baking process and the whole toasted nuts inside, make Feqqas satisfyingly crunchy and delicious while the sweetness of the dried fruits adds an extra layer of flavor. Feqqas are a popular snack during weddings, feasts, and various celebrations."
"Chebakya is a delicious Moroccan sweet that is perfectly golden and fried. It is made with a combination of toasted sesame seeds, ground anise, cinnamon, and other ingredients. After frying, it is soaked in a mixture of honey and orange blossom water.

This iconic pastry has a unique and intricate shape, which is where its name chebakya, meaning the interlocking, comes from.

Chebakya holds a special significance in both cultural and religious contexts. It is not only a key part of Ramadan iftar, but it also serves as a meaningful ritual. In the weeks leading up to Ramadan, young children gather together to learn the art of shaping chebakya from the older generations.

Creating intricate shapes is seen as an accomplishment, and it becomes a bonding experience for the whole family."
"Sellou, also known as Sfouf, is an incredibly nutritious sweet that combines a rich variety of ingredients, including almonds, sesame seeds, olive oil (or melted butter), honey, anise, roasted flour, and more.
This sweet has a dense and crumbly texture and is packed with energy, making it a perfect choice during Ramadan. It is also commonly served at postpartum parties to help the new mother recover. Sellou can be beautifully decorated and given as favors to guests.
The recipe and appearance of Sellou vary from region to region, and it is common to incorporate local ingredients such as Argan oil. Regardless of the specific recipe, Sellou stands out as a unique sweet because it is more than just a pastry — it serves as a nourishing supplement. It breaks the stereotype of traditional sweets and offers a satisfying and nutritious treat."
"Qrichlate are tiny buns that are prepared once a year as part of a religious celebration called Achoura. These sweets are typically made in large quantities, and it is rare for just one person to make them. The process is a collaborative effort, emphasizing teamwork.
The main ingredients used in qrichlate are flour, oil, sugar, sesame seeds, and anise. Once the buns are ready and rested, they are mixed in large bowls with dried fruits and nuts such as dates, figs, dried grapes, and peanuts. Qrichlate is then served with mint tea to visitors throughout the day."
"Meskouta is a mouthwatering Moroccan orange cake that holds a prominent place on afternoon tea tables in many Moroccan households.

There are various recipes for meskouta, each unique to different cities. The key ingredients are eggs, sugar, oil, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla sugar (some variations include yogurt or milk), flour, and sugar. Making meskouta is relatively easy and offers plenty of room for creativity.

You can choose to glaze it with jam, honey, chocolate ganache, or any other topping, or even leave it plain!"
"Briouate are golden triangles of crispy fried pastry (Filo) filled with delicious almond paste and dipped into a mixture of honey and orange blossom water. This Moroccan classic is TO DIE FOR.
It is everyone’s favorite during Ramadan iftars (the first meal to break the fast at sunset), feasts, and any special occasion. 
Briouate is mainly served with Moroccan mint tea along with other pastries in the afternoon or during the day when receiving visitors during feasts and special occasions."
"Ghriba is an umbrella name of a group of cookies that are all of the same round shape and have a perfectly cracked top.
This cookie can be enjoyed with mint tea in the afternoon, at parties, or for feast breakfasts. The cool thing is that you never get bored with this one as there are so many versions of it, making it suitable for every taste. Let’s name some: coconut ghriba, semolina ghriba, ghriba behla (more flour, less crispy), and ghriba nkhala (bran).
This pastry can be found on every wedding and party table and is affordable to everyone, which makes it an absolute favorite."
"Mhencha, also known as snake cake, derives its name from its distinctive snake-like shape. Despite its dense texture and intense sweetness, this dessert has been a staple at wedding buffets for generations.

Mhencha is crafted by layering almond paste within werqa (filo) pastry, baking it until crisp, and then drenching it in honey syrup. It can then be decorated with edible rose petals, sugar powder, or toasted almonds.

Mhencha appears at every Moroccan wedding and it’s almost the only recipe that doesn’t have more than one version. This classic remains a nostalgic dessert, making the childhood of many generations, especially 1970’s and 80’s babies."
"Kaab el ghzal, also known as gazelle horns, is one of the oldest known Moroccan sweets and has passed down through many generations. It used to be considered a delicacy, reserved exclusively for the elite due to the use of high-quality ingredients and the great skill required.
Almond paste is wrapped in a very thin dough, and it is all scented with orange blossom. The hint of orange transports most Moroccans on a nostalgic journey into the past. 
Kaab el ghzal was (and still is) one of the fundamental pastries served during weddings and on special occasions. It is also served with Moroccan tea in the afternoons at some of the fanciest cafés."
"Bastilla is one of the fanciest Moroccan dishes. Back in the day, it was the dish to serve on special occasions such as weddings, but now it’s available in almost every Moroccan restaurant throughout the year. 

The original recipe was based on two main elements: pigeons and almonds. This is a highly successful sweet and sour combination separated by a very crispy werqa pastry. In one bite, you experience the flavors of almonds, cinnamon, orange blossom water, tender pigeon, fresh parsley, and eggs.

The eggs are used with reduced sauce, creating a thin layer that acts as a bridge between the savory pigeon filling and the rich almond.

This iconic dish never fails to impress, but, today, new versions of bastilla have been created, inspired by the original recipe. One popular variation is chicken bastilla, a more affordable option but equally delicious. There is also a seafood bastilla, but this comes without the sweet element. These adaptations allow us all to enjoy the flavors of bastilla in ways that suit our preferences."
"Msemmen is often described as Moroccan pancake bread. It is known for its buttery and flaky texture, which adds to its deliciousness. This amazing treat is made with a base of flour, semolina, and butter which is then enhanced with sweet or sour fillings such as cheese, olives, honey, or jam.

Msemmen is one of the daily elements of street food breakfasts. It is very common to serve freshly baked Msemmens with tea in every Moroccan household as an afternoon snack."
"Meqrout is a very sweet and crunchy pastry that is often served alongside chebakya. The main ingredients are semolina, date paste filling, and honey. Meqrouts are cut in a diamond shape, deep-fried until golden, and soaked in honey. The result is a sticky and absolutely delightful sweet. 
During Ramadan, meqrout is often served together with harira. Some people prefer meqrout to chebakya, as it has higher nutritional value given the date paste filling. However, it’s important to note that meqrout can be an explosion of sweetness, so moderation is advised."
"Jawhara, also known as the Jewel, lives up to its name as a timeless classic of Moroccan pastries. Despite its simple appearance, the unique techniques and special ingredients mean it stands out, particularly in the sauce and presentation. 

Jawhara is basically sweet, crunchy layers of fried pastry scented with orange blossom cream and toasted almonds. The cream is made with milk, sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon while the pastry is standard Moroccan werqa. 

You can alternate the fried werqa with a milk sauce and toasted almonds vertically to get a delicious round tower. You can also decorate it with a topping of your choice (almonds and honey are great options) and bon appétit!"
"Beghrir, also known as Moroccan crepes, is a type of crepe served during breakfast on religious feasts such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al Adha. It is also enjoyed for iftar during Ramadan. These crepes are unique with their characteristic thousand holes. 

They are salty and fluffy, are made with semolina and flour, and are traditionally served with melted butter and honey sauce. As humble as they look, this is one of the trickiest recipes in Moroccan cuisine and many are known to still be struggling to produce it. The crepes need to start developing holes while cooking — the more holes you get the better."
"Krachel, known as grissate in some regions, are sweet Moroccan brioches flavored with sesame seeds, anise, and orange blossom. They are typically served for breakfast or as a snack and can also be found on some Ramadan tables for iftar. Krachel is primarily made with flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and yeast. It is commonly made at home and packed into children lunch boxes. Krachel worked its way through history among middle-class families and is still one of the most nostalgic Moroccan pastries enjoyed by people of all ages."
"Sfenj is Morocco’s take on donuts, and it’s sinfully delicious. Leavened dough is shaped into rings and deep-fried into golden perfection. They’re crisp on the outside and chewy and fluffy on the inside. To flavor the donuts, all you need is a simple dusting of sugar."
"Kefta is kind of like a Moroccan-style meatball. It’s made of either ground beef or lamb (sometimes both) and is flavored with cumin, paprika, onion, lemon juice, coriander, and parsley.
Once the meat patties are formed and seasoned, they are then placed on skewers and cooked until done. You can also broil them in the oven if you are cooking at home.
Alternatively, you can also eat kefta as part of a tajine. It includes eggs as well as the kefta and amazing tomato sauce that is flavored with peppers, onions, and parsley.
If you’ve ever had Shakshuka or a Berber Omelet that is exactly what Kefta Tajine tastes like, except they add the Kefta to it. It’s a super good dish and is usually eaten with bread since you use that to scoop the tajine up."
"The name “Cornes de Gazella” literally means Gazelle horns in English and refers to the unique, crescent moon shape of these amazing cookies.
Generally, these little sugar bombs are made from a flour-based dough that is stuffed with almond paste and sprinkled with orange flower water. The result? A delicious dessert that you cannot stop eating.
I like to eat mine with mint tea and I particularly liked the ones from Pâtisserie Bennis Habous the last time I was in Casablanca after deciding that Casablanca was worth visiting."
"Amlou is a bit like almond butter, only WAY better since it is sweeter and made with this beautiful combination of almonds (or peanuts), honey, and argan oil.
It’s definitely a bit of a breakfast food and a lot of people like to eat it with harcha, bread, msemen, and beghrir.
It’s also pretty special since argan trees are only found in Morocco. Therefore, you can really only find Amlou in Morocco since it’s made with argan oil.
But, the best part? If you’re looking for cool souvenirs in Morocco then go to the Medina of most Moroccan cities (preferably ones in the south since it is cheaper/better there) and pick up a giant bottle today."
"Atay or Mint tea is no joke in Morocco and people will drink it morning, noon, and night, especially at some of the best cafes in Marrakech, since any time is a good time to drink mint tea.
You 100% should be able to find it just about anywhere in the country. But, the way its served can be a little different based on where you are.
In the north, they like to serve it in tall glasses with sugar and mint. In the south, they like to serve it in a small teapot with sugar and mint on the side. Either way, it is delicious and a must-try in Morocco.
Just know that the mint in the south does tend to be better, with places like Marrakech and Tiznit having some of the best mint in the country.
Generally, to make mint tea, you boil the water and then add your fave packaged tea to it. We like to use the lion brand tea but you can use any tea you like.
When the tea is ready and has the right color, bring it out in a pot with mint and sugar on the side. People can then add as much sugar/mint to their tea as they like.

So, go out and drink as much mint tea as possible since there is really nothing more Moroccan than mint tea."
"You know how I said bread is life in Morocco? Well, there are about ten different types of bread that you should try while you’re in Morocco. And Msemen is one of them.
Okay, it’s not really bread but more like a fried square (sometimes round) pancake that is savory and made out of Semolina flour.
Essentially, the dough is made using a mixture of all-purpose flour, semolina, salt, water, and vegetable oil. The dough is then divided into balls that are flattened and folded to create tons of layers.
Butter, oil, or Moroccan spices (like cumin and paprika) can then be placed in between the layers to add flavor. This dough is then fried in a pan until it is nice and brown and ready to eat.
99.9% of the msemen that you will find at hotel breakfasts and in restaurants is terrible. Sorry, but it is true. It is usually old and dry and tastes like sandpaper.
If you want to try GOOD msemen, go to a Moroccan breakfast joint or creamery and order it early in the morning or early in the evening. This is when it is fresh and will be served to you hot, right out of the pan.
It is also usually paired with amlou (kind of like almond butter), honey, spreadable cheese, jam, etc. Just take your knife and spread your topping of choice on top of the msemen.
When you are done, roll it up and eat it as is. It is very tasty and is best eaten when it is fresh and hot. So, if you order it at a weird time of day (i.e. not in the morning and not in the early evening) then don’t be surprised if it tastes old and gross."
"Loubia is amazing and is this rich and flavorful white bean stew that is cooked for many hours. It is made using spices like cumin, paprika, and garlic as well as olive oil, onions, and tomatoes.
Traditionally, this stew is made with lamb or beef. However, my partner’s mom makes an amazing vegetarian version since my partner doesn’t eat lamb or beef. Yup, he is like the only Moroccan vegetarian I have ever met.
Typically we just eat our Loubia with a spoon and some crusty bread. However, I do know other people who sometimes eat it with couscous.
Either way, it is super delicious and is one of the most traditional foods in Morocco. That being said, Loubia usually isn’t on the menu at most restaurants and can be REALLY hard to find unless you go to someone’s house.
So, if you want to try Loubia, I suggest signing up for a cooking class and asking if they can teach you how to make it."

" Moroccan olive oil is so loved in Morocco that each family keeps gallons in their pantry to ensure they never run out.
You can use any olive oil you have as long as it’s 100% pure, but if you like trying new flavors, please get a pure Moroccan olive oil. It’s very different from the olive oils you find in the supermarket. It has a sweetness and delicacy makes it enjoyable with just a slice of bread.
In Morocco, olive oil is poured into small plates, and the guests enjoy it by dipping their bread directly in the oil."
"Harsha is another delicious Moroccan pastry often served at Moroccan breakfasts. Like the Baghrir, Moroccan Harsha is made using semolina and is really easy to make. It’s crunchy and a little salty and goes wonderfully with the other ingredients served in Moroccan breakfasts, like the Jben, honey, and olives."
"Moroccan Harsha, or Harcha, is also made with semolina and is a crunchy, slightly thicker bread that is circular in shape.
Harsha is also cooked on a griddle, and is served with a selection of the accompaniments that you will discover in just a second."
"Amlou was one of my favourite discoveries in Morocco and in my opinion, no Moroccan breakfast is complete without it!
Some compare Amlou to a kind of peanut butter, but I think that this is doing it a disservice.
Amlou is made with honey, roasted almonds and argan oil, and it is more of a liquid than a spread, perfect for dipping bread into.
It is smooth in texture, slightly sweet, and absolutely delicious."
"Olive oil is always served at a Moroccan breakfast table, without exception. In fact, many press their very own olive oil and have enough of the stuff in their pantries to survive several zombie apocalypses!"
"Argan oil is produced from the nuts of the Argan tree, and many local women’s co-operatives make Argan oil by themselves and sell it in its pure form, as well as in various cosmetics, creams and more.
Argan oil has numerous health benefits, and you will always see it in its own little pot next to the olive oil."
"Dchicha is a slightly less common Moroccan breakfast dish, but if you visit Morocco in the cooler months, you may be lucky enough to try it.
Served as a light supper or breakfast food, Dchicha is made from cracked wheat and flavoured with ginger, saffron and paprika."
"B’ssara, or Bissara, is a Moroccan soup made from fava beans and is popular during the winter months.
This is a thick soup flavoured with paprika, garlic and cumin, and while you may find it a little odd to eat soup for breakfast, you really shouldn’t knock it until you’ve tried it!"
"Baghrir are Moroccan pancakes made from semolina, and they are known as the ‘1000 hole pancake’ thanks to the dozens of small holes on the top.
If you’re familiar with an English crumpet, you will find the appearance very similar!
They are fairly plain in taste, but usually served (warm!) with a honey and butter syrup."
"Moroccans will drink cups of sweet mint tea at any time of day, and so naturally you’ll find a teapot on the breakfast table.
Mint tea is made from Chinese gunpowder green tea with fresh mint leaves and copious amounts of sugar,
Fun fact – I once won a mint tea making competition in the Atlas Mountains! I’m pretty sure I still have the certificate somewhere…"
