The Diplomatickitchen version of this flatbread consistently uses 7 tablespoons of water. The signs that the dough is done are the same no matter what flour is used and are described in the instructions below."", ""A question of timing:"", ""The dough for Moroccan Flatbread may be made and used after a 30 minute rest. Another method is to mix the dough the night before using it, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature until the next day. Either timing makes a good flatbread. There are small differences in the results. The overnight version is slightly more pliable and tears less easily than the quicker one which is somewhat less elastic and resembles tortilla dough in its texture. Also, the overnight timing makes a slightly puffier flatbread. The question is rather which bread you prefer and which timing, than which is better. (Both types are pictured in the related link.)"", ""You will also need:"", ""1. Two small bowls, a large mixing bowl and, for the overnight method, a medium-sized bowl for resting the dough."", ""2.

After a few minutes of mixing, if there remain scraps and flakes of dryish dough at the bottom of the bowl that will not combine easily with the dough ball, add the reserved 1 tablespoon of water. Continue mixing. If you have added an additional tablespoon of water, the dough will now appear sticky and leave a liquid-ey flour paste on the sides of the bowl. But further mixing (not more flour) will change the dough's texture. It is ready when the sides of the bowl are clean and the dough forms a compact, not very sticky ball. Leave it to rest, covered, for 30 minutes or place it in a dry bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature overnight."", ""Making the filling:"", ""1.
