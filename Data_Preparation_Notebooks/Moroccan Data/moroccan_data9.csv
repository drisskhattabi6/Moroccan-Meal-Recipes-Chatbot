Traditional Round Khobz Bread,4c and a little extra white flour - do not use self rising flour! ( you can also use wheat or half of each flour) - 2 c warm water - 1 Tbsp active dry yeast (or 1 pkg of Red Star or like brand) - 2 tsp salt - 1 tsp sugar,"In a small bowl add yeast, sugar and 1c warm water. Mix well and allow yeast to bubble. In a large bowl add flour and salt. After yeast/water mixture begins to bubble pour into bowl with flour. Begin combining flour and water. Have another cup of warm water to the side and add slowly to flour mixture. You may not use the entire cup. Continue combining flour and water until you can form a ball. At this point it should be a bit sticky. Pour vegetable oil into your hands and proceeds to work it into the dough. Again you may not use a full 1/4 cup. Most of the dough should come off of your hands and combine into the dough that will be elastic but no longer sticky. Knead for 8-10 minutes. You can do this by hand or in a mixer - if using a mixer reduce the time to approximately 5 minutes. Oil the ball and the bowl and cover. Allow to rest 15 minutes. Divide dough into 2-3 portions depending on the size of the bread you would like. Using the divided pieces form 2-3 smaller balls. Sprinkle flour on a board or counter-top and begin to push down the ball beginning in the center, similar to how you would form a pizza crust. Moroccan bread is traditionally in a circle shape however whatever shape you make it will not really matter! The dough should be about 1/4"" thick and even on all sides. Wrap in a towel and continue for the remainder of the portions. Allow dough to rise about 45 minutes. Preheat the over to 400-425F. Once dough has risen prick with a from several times and place on a cookie sheet or baking stone into the oven. Cook until it begins to brown and makes a hallow sound when tapped - about 18-20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.",95
Batbout – Moroccan Pita Bread,"4 cups white flour - 2 cups semolina or wheat flour - 2 Tbsp plus 1 teaspoon sugar - 2 tsp salt - 3 tablespoons vegetable oil - 1 Tbsp active yeast - 2 cups water (approximate), divided","Activate the yeast by mixing it with ¼ cup of warm (not hot) water and a teaspoon of sugar. Set aside the mixture until it’s frothy, about five to 10 minutes. Blend the flours, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the yeast, the oil and the rest of the water, and mix to form a dough. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it’s too sticky to work with, add a little flour one tablespoon at a time. (Remember the dough will absorb a bit more flour if you knead it by hand.) If the dough feels a bit stiff, work in additional water, a tablespoon at a time. Knead the dough in a mixer with a dough hook, or by hand on a lightly floured surface, for about 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into smooth balls and leave them to rest, covered, on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes. Roll out each ball into a thin circle about ⅛ inch thick. Set the rolled out dough on a clean, dry towel and cover. Leave to rise for about 1 to 1½ hours. Preheat a very lightly oiled cast iron skillet, griddle or other non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook the batbout, turning several times, until golden brown on both sides. The browning will be a bit uneven since the bread puffs up as it cooks, but that’s okay. Transfer the cooked batbout to a rack to cool. It’s okay to stack them while they’re warm.",165
"Msemmen, Batbout Bread",3 cups all-purpose flour - 2 cups semolina flour - 2 tsp salt - 1 tsp dry activated yeast - 2 tsp sugar - warm water - - 1/2 cup vegetable (any unflavored oil) - - 14/ cup melted butter - extra semolina for dusting - non stick pan for cooking,"To make this bread does require a few steps. I have taken several pictures to walk you through it as well as a video that will show you the folding technique for the bread.  You'll want to have a large work surface. I usually knead my bread and pasta flour right on the counter top but if you have a butcher block or large cutting board that works too. Combine the flour and semolina as well as the salt, sugar and yeast all together. Create a small well in the middle. Begin pouring in warm water a little at a time. There's no exact amount of water to add. You'll need to add and knead as you go.  Keep working the dough. My sister in law has always told me listen until it starts to sound like snapping chewing gum when you push it down and pull it back. Then it's ready. The final texture shouldn't be sticky, but smooth with a little resistance.  Allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes. Then break off equal parts of the dough to form smaller balls. These will become the individual breads.  Give the smaller balls an additional 10 minutes of resting time. On your workspace spread some oil and begin to flatten the first ball. Work from the center and push outwards. When the dough has doubled it's size flip it, adding more oil to the top and continue pressing from the center outward. (the video will help illustrate this). You will create a large round piece of dough that should be see through. Coat the dough with butter and sprinkle with semolina. Fold one side down to create a triangle, and then do the same on the opposite side. Add more butter and semolina to the area that has been exposed from the folding. Repeat this until you've created a shape a bit like a pentagon. Set aside and continue to the next piece of dough. When you have 3, the first dough has rested and can move to the next step. Gather the edges and fold them in on themselves again. Then pull up all of the corners to create a bundle. Twist the combined edges to form a seal and flip over. You will have created a thick dough ball.  Continue doing this process until all of the dough has been made into the parcels. Use butter and oil liberally as you prepare the bread. To cook you'll heat a non-stick skillet to medium heat. Start with the first dough ball you created and working from the center outward flatten it to approximately 1/4"" thickness. Add some oil to the skillet and place the bread in the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook an additional 2-2 minutes on the opposite side. You should end up with bread that is browned and a bit crispy on the outside. Repeat until all of the bread has been cooked. Serve with honey or jam and of course mint tea!",105
Traditional Msemmen,3½ cups flour (340 g) - ½ cup fine semolina (90g) - 2 tsp sugar - 2 tsp salt - 1 teaspoon yeast - 1½ cups warm water (approx. ⅓ liter) - 1½ cups vegetable oil - 1/2 cup fine semolina - ¼ cup very soft unsalted butter,"Mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add 1½ cups of warm water, and mix to form a dough. Add more water if necessary to make a dough that is soft and easy to knead, but not sticky. If the dough is too sticky to handle, add a little flour one tablespoon at a time. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for 10 minutes, (or knead the dough in a stand mixer with dough hook for 5 minutes), until the dough is very smooth and elastic. Set a bowl of the melted/soft butter and some oil aside. Cover your hands with oil. Begin by dividing the dough into golf ball size balls. Continue until all the dough is divided. Starting with the first ball you made, add more of the butter mixture to your hands and work surface. Flatten the ball to a very, very thin layer. Rub some oil on top, and fold into thirds. Add some more oil and sprinkle some semolina on the strip and fold again into thirds. You should now have a small square of dough. Continue through the remaining balls. Heat up a skillet and add a small amount of oil to the pan. Keep it on a medium heat. Starting with the first “package” that you assembled, oil your hands and begin flattening the dough. It should be thin and remain in a square shape. Do not overwork or the layers meld together. Place into the warm skillet and cook until golden brown and slightly crunchy on he outside. If it does not turn to a golden color, you are not using enough oil.",75

Rub some oil on top and spread a thin layer of the meat and spice paste. Fold into thirds vertically. Add some more oil and sprinkle semolina on the strip and fold again into thirds. You should now have a small square of dough. Continue the same process for the remaining dough balls. Heat a skillet and add a small amount of oil to the pan. Keep it on a medium heat. Starting with the first dough square that you assembled, oil your hands and begin flattening the dough. It should be thin and remain in a square shape. Do not overwork or the layers meld together. Also do not push too hard so that the dough breaks. Place into the warm skillet and cook until golden brown and slightly crunchy on he outside. If it does not turn to a golden color, you are not using enough oil. These are best served hot, but can also be frozen and reheated later.",75
Moroccan Jewish Moufletta,"3 3/4 cups flour - 1 1/2 cups warm (not boiling) water - 1 Tbsp yeast - pinch of sugar - Pinch of salt - Vegetable (not olive) oil, as needed","In a small bowl add the yeast, sugar and a little bit of warm water. Leave alone for 5 minutes for the yeast to activate. In another bowl, add the flour and salt. Start pouring the activated yeast and mix the flour with your hand, just as if you were making bread. Continue adding water a little bit at a time until the flour is all incorporated. Knewad until a light and elastic dough is formed. This will take approximately 5 minutes.  Divide dough into small balls. They can be any size you like, the smaller the balls the smaller the final product and vice versa. I divided this recipe into 16 pieces but it could also be 20. Cover with dish towel and let stand 20 minutes on a flat, well-oiled surface.  Oil hands and on an oiled surface, place each ball of dough. Use your fingers to push down and spread to form a thin sheet of dough. Pour a small amount of oil in frying pan. Heat to medium and transfer the dough sheet to the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes on this side and flip.  Make a second sheet of dough and place it on top of the cooked bread in the pan. Continue until all of the dough is used. Melt honey and butter in a separate pan and use it to drizzle over the moufleta. This part shouldn't be skimped on!",60
Beghrir – 1000 Hole Pancakes,"2 cups fine semolina or cornmeal (preferably semolina) - 1 cup all-purpose flour - 1 tbsp dry yeast - ¼ teaspoon baking powder - ½ teaspoon salt - ½ teaspoon sugar - 1 egg - 1 cup milk, warm but comfortable to the touch - 2 cups water, warm but comfortable to the touch"," Mix all of the ingredients together and beat until blended well. You can do this either by beating with a wire whisk or mixing everything in a blender. I like the results of the blender better but use what you have available. Allow it to rest 20-30 minutes. Heat a non stick skillet on medium heat until hot; I add a little butter on the first batch to make sure the pan is ready.  Cook on one side until the exposed side is full of little bubbles and dry. These pancakes only cook on one side. Remove from the heat once the top looks a bit dry. Traditionally they are served with honey butter but I spread Nutella on, then rolled them up and served with some raspberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. ",30
Tigrifine – Moroccan Flat Bread,3 cups all purpose flour - 1/2 tsp yeast - 1 tsp salt - warm water - just above room temperature,"In a large bowl or work surface combine the flour, yeast and salt. Begin adding water slowly to work into the flour. Continue adding water until a sticky dough is formed. Knead the dough for 5-8 minutes until it is no longer sticky and when pushed with a finger bounces back. Leave to rest 5-10 minutes Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Divide the dough into equal parts. To create each of the bread pieces push the dough down from the center outward to create a circle - just as you would a pizza crust. Flatten until the dough is about 1/2 cm thick and transfer to the skillet. Cook on the first side for 30 seconds and flip. Keep cooking for approximately 5 minutes, flipping as the underside begins to brown. You will notice the dough may start to bubble in spots - you want this, no need to puncture the bubbles. Remove from heat and continue the process through all of the dough. Serve with butter and honey (or amalou would be great too!)",50
Moroccan Challah Bread,"4 cups white flour - 1/2 Tbsp honey or sugar - 2 Tbsp dry yeast - 1/2 Tbsp salt - 1 egg - 1/4c vegetable or olive oil - 2-3 cups warm water - a bit of extra oil to brush the dough with or an additional egg (for the wash) - sesame seeds, anise seeds, sugar, and cinnamon, or other spices to top the bread","You will need a large space to mix and knead your dough if doing it by hand. My instructions will be for hand kneading though you can use a stand mixer if you have one. Sift the flour to remove any impurities and lighten it a bit. In a small bowl add the yeast, honey and a bit of warm water. Leave it alone for 3-4 minutes until the yeast begins to bubble. In another bowl whisk together the oil and egg. Make a well in the flour and add the egg and oil mixture, salt, and yeast. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine the liquid and flour. Begin to knead by hand, adding the water a little bit at a time until everything is incorporated. The dough will be a bit firm to begin with but as you knead it will soften. If it feels dry, add a little more water but only a small amount at a time. The dough will be kneaded for 6-8 minutes until soft and smooth. Coat with a light layer of oil and cover with a towel. Put in a warm spot in your kitchen and allow to rise approximately 1 hour. When the dough has risen, cut into 4 equal pieces. Now you can shape the dough how you would like. Have a large baking sheet (or two smaller ones) covered with parchment paper ready for the bread. Flower Pattern This is my term for this shape. With one of the 4 pieces of dough divide it into two equal parts. Roll each out into equal-sized ""snakes"". Cut each into three equal pieces so you have 6 total pieces. Place one in the middle and then the other 5 around the center. Turban/Crown Take one of the 4 pieces of dough you started with and divide it into two pieces. Roll each of these out into a long snake - the thickness is completely up to you but aim for two pieces that are of equal thickness. Twist the two tubes together, pressing the top of the tube to keep them from separating. Twist until the end. Roll the open end up to create a circle shape. Press the ends into the dough so that they don't open up. Preheat the oven to 400F, cover the dough with the towel again, and leave to rise an additional 20 minutes. Brush the tops of the bread with a bit of extra oil or crack the egg and whisk and then brush over the top of the bread. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, anise seeds or nigella seeds. You could also sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar or leave it plain. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 15 minutes. It should be brown on top and sound hollow when you tap it. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.",110
Moroccan Parsley Bread,"4 cups white flour - 1 teaspoon sugar - 2 tsp salt - 3/4 - 1 Tbsp active yeast - 2 cups water (approximate), divided - Chopped parsley or another herb - Vegetable or olive oil for cooking (optional)","Activate the yeast by mixing it with ¼ cup of warm (not hot) water and the sugar. Set aside the mixture until it’s frothy, about five minutes. Add the flour to a large mixing bowl along with the salt and give a quick mix. Add the yeast and begin to mix, adding more water as needed to incorporate all of the dough. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it’s too sticky to work with, add a little flour one tablespoon at a time. (Remember the dough will absorb a bit more flour if you knead it by hand.) If the dough feels a bit stiff, work in additional water, a tablespoon at a time. Knead the dough in a mixer with a dough hook, or by hand on a lightly floured surface, for about 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into smooth balls and leave them to rest, covered, on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes. Roll out each ball into a thin circle about ⅛ inch thick. Set the rolled out dough on a clean, dry towel and cover. Leave to rise for about 1 hour. Preheat a very lightly oiled cast iron skillet, griddle or other non-stick pan over medium heat. You can also leave the oil off but I find it adds a nice bit of color. Cook the batbout, turning several times, until golden brown on both sides. The browning will be a bit uneven since the bread puffs up as it cooks, but that’s okay. Transfer the cooked batbout to a rack to cool. It’s okay to stack them while they’re warm. Brush the bread with olive oil or melted butter and sprinkle with fresh parsley.",80

Turn out on a floured surface and knead for 7-10 minutes until smooth and soft. If the dough is still sticking to your hands more than itself, add a bit more flour a tbsp/7g at a time.  Place dough into a greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth.  Place in a warm location and allow rising until 2.5-3x the size, about 1 hour, depending on the ambient temperature.  Preheat oven to 475°F/250 C. Place a heavy baking sheet in the oven to heat as well. Turn out on the lightly floured surface and cut into 15 equal pieces.  With each piece, fold the edges into the center and roll between your palms to form a ball. Set aside to rest for 5-7 minutes, covered with a cloth so the gluten relaxes.  On a well-floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a 5”/12.5cm circle slightly more than ¼”/6mm thick.  Rest the formed pitas for 15 minutes. Bake 3-5 pitas at a time by placing them on the preheated baking sheet. Bake for 2-3 minutes until well puffed (but not turning brown). Remove immediately and place a new batch in the oven. Once removed from the oven, the pitas will collapse but will still have the pocket inside when cut open.  Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.",140

Moroccan Taktouka,"4 tomatoes - skins removed and chopped up - 2 large green peppers (roasted - will describe in directions) - 1 large clove of garlic, finely chopped or pressed - 1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste) - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper - 1 tablespoon paprika - 2 teaspoons cumin - 1/4 teaspoon turmeric - 1/3 cup olive oil","To Roast Green Peppers: Traditionally these are roasted over an open gas flame until the outside is completely black. My mother in law then tosses them into a plastic bag that is sealed until the steam inside loosens the skins and it can easily be pulled away from the flesh. On gas stoves in the US this works great. and this is how I generally roast these peppers. You could also do them under the broiler of an oven on a cookie sheet but make sure to watch carefully and turn them often so that they do not catch on fire.  To Remove Tomato Skin: If you are good at peeling these with a paring knife go ahead, unfortunately I am not so good. Instead place a pot of water on high until boiling and score each tomato with an X. Once water is boiling put the tomatoes in and cook for 2-3 minutes. The skins will become loose and peel right off. You do not have to peel the tomatoes if you don't want for this recipe. Once the skin of the vegetables is removed, chop both the tomatoes and peppers into small pieces.  In a large pan pour 2/3 of the olive oil and bring to medium heat. Saute the garlic for 1-2 minutes and then add the green peppers and tomatoes.  Add the spices to the tomatoes and peppers. Continue to cook on medium high stirring occasionally until the the tomatoes are very soft and can easily be mashed. This may take less time depending on whether or not the tomatoes were soft from removing the skins. Mash the tomatoes with a fork or spoon and continue cooking until the liquid is reduced. If it becomes to dry add the leftover oil. Once it has reached a consistency you like remove from heat.",40
"Potato, Carrot and Rice Salad","2-3 small to medium potatoes - 2 carrots - 3/4 cup of rice, rinsed - 1 tbsp mayo (real mayo folks) - 1/2 tsp cumin - salt and pepper to taste","Peel potatoes and carrots.  Boil in water until tender but not too soft, they should still have a slight bite.  Think something equivalent to al dente pasta.  In a separate pan boil 1 cup of water to 3/4c rice.  Cook until tender, adding more water if needed.  (Check the package, cooking time and ration will depend on the type of rice you use.) The carrots will most likely be tender ahead of the potatoes. Remove from water and put into cool water right away.  This will help keep the color.  Once cool to the touch, quarter each carrot and cut into small squares. Place into a large bowl. Do the same thing with the potatoes' once they are tender.  Add to the bowl with carrots. When rice is tender rice with cold water to cool off.  Add to bowl with carrots and potatoes.  Take one heaping spoon of mayo and mix into the vegetables and rice. Stir softly, so as not to break up the potatoes, until mayo is combined.

Once the meatballs are cooked through, crack 3 eggs and place them on top of the meatballs and sauce. Cover the tajine again so that the eggs can cook through.

After 45 minutes check the meat. It should fall apart when a fork pulls at it. The length of time needed to cook the meat will depend on the thickness and cut of meat that you use. Continue adding liquid and checking doneness until the meat is tender. When you begin to cook the meat you can prepare the quince. Peel the quince (if fresh) and cut into chunks about the same size. It doesn't matter what shape they are as long as they are uniform. In a saucepan add the quince along with the water, sugar and cinnamon. Cook on low to medium heat along with the tagine. They should cook for about 45 minutes or longer. Again it will depend on the size they have been cut into. The quince are cooked when a fork can go through them easily. I like to take a few of the quince and add them to the tagine while it's cooking and mash them into the sauce. This thickens the sauce and also adds the flavor of the quince a bit more. To serve lightly toast the pistachios, add the quince to the top of the tagine with any of the liquid that remains in the pot and top with the pistachios. This is eaten by scooping it up with Moroccan bread but can also be eaten with a fork.",135

Mix in a teaspoon of honey at the very end and allow for a few more minutes of cooking. You can also top with sesame seeds right before serving. ",105
Sweet Chicken Tajine,"1 tsp oil - 1 onion, sliced - 1 lb chicken thighs, bone in, with skin removed - 1 Tbsp parsley - 1 tsp cinnamon - 1 tsp garlic powder - 1 tsp ginger - ½ tsp cumin - ¼ tsp black pepper - 1 (14 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained - 2 Tbsp honey - 1/3 c raisins - 2 c cooked chickpeas","Heat oil in a Dutch oven, over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until soft. Push onions to the side and add meat, searing on all sides. Add spices and remaining ingredients in the order listed. Cover and cook over low heat for 40 min. Remove lid and check to be sure there is enough, but not too much liquid. There should be just enough liquid to keep the ingredients moist, but not so much that you find yourself with a soup. For too much liquid, simmer 10-20 min uncovered. For not enough liquid, add water ¼ c at a time and simmer, covered, for an additional 10-20 min. Remove from heat and serve hot.",105
How to Make Moroccan Chicken Slow Cooker Tajine,1 lb chicken meat - 1 white onion - 3 Tbsp olive oil - 1.5 Tbsp cumin - ½ Tbsp turmeric - ¾ Tbsp salt - ½ Tbsp pepper - 1 Tbsp ginger - 3 cloves garlic - 3-4 sprigs each of parsley and cilantro - 1/2 cup water - ½ lemon or ¼ preserved lemon - ½ lb potatoes (I used small new potatoes) - 1 cup fresh or frozen peas,"Add olive oil to the bottom of the slow cooker. Cut onion into slices and add to the bottom of the slow cooker. Remove skin from the garlic cloves and add to the pot.  Clean chicken and cut (if desired) into smaller pieces. I used breasts and cut them into 3 pieces each. This just helps speed up cooking time. Place into a bowl. Add all of the spices to the chicken and mix well to combine.  Once the chicken has been seasoned, add it to the top of the onions. I try to keep most of the onions on the bottom as much as possible so that they cook down. Tie the cilantro/parsley together with a kitchen string or using the stem of one of the herbs and place it in the pot. Add the lemon broken (if preserved) or cut if fresh into a few pieces. Finally, add 1/2 cup of water. Try not to pour directly on the chicken but around it so you don't rinse off all the spices. Turn the heat to high or low depending on how long you want to cook. A high time will cook in about 4hours while a low in about 6 hours. If you are using small, new potatoes, let the chicken cook on high heat for about 2 hours and then add the potatoes. If you plan to cook on low longer you can add them in the beginning. If you are using larger potatoes you can also add them in the beginning. I place these on top of the onions but under the chicken to cook.  In the last 15 minutes add the peas. The meat should be falling off the bone and the vegetables tender. If you have a lot of liquid left, you can reduce it on the stovetop if desired.",310
Braniya {Lamb and Eggplant Tagine},"2 lb of lamb, any cut works, I like a cut up rack or neck pieces - 1/2 large onion chopped finely - 1 Tbsp crushed garlic - 1/2 preserved lemon - 2 tsp liquid from preserved lemons - 1 1/2 tbsp ginger powder or 1 Tbsp fresh grated ginger - 1 handful chopped Italian parsley - 2 tsp olive oil - 1 tsp black pepper - pinch of saffron threads - 4tsp water + more as needed - 1 large or 2 small eggplants - 2 tsp vinegar - vegetable oil for frying - 6-8 Tbsp liquid from cooking tajine","In the bottom of a large tajine, add the olive oil and onions. Remember to follow all stovetop cooking directions for your tajine. Turn the heat to medium low and allow the tajine to heat up. Meanwhile, clean and trim the lamb you will be using. In a bowl add the preserved lemon liquid, ginger, black pepper, and garlic. In a smaller bowl crush the saffron threads between your fingers and put into the bowl. Add 2 tsp warm water and leave for about 5 minutes. Then, mix with the lemon mixture. Rub lamb pieces with the marinade, adding the chopped parsley to the top. Place the pieces of lamb into the tajine, arranging so that all the pieces fit when covered. Break up the preserved lemon with your fingers and slide into cavities all around the tajine. Add 2 tsp of water to the bottom of the tajine, cover, and leave it alone! After 1 1/2 hours check the tajine. There should be plenty of liquid from the meat cooking. If not, add some water. Peel eggplant and cut into 1/2 inch rounds. Place the rounds into a large bowl full of salted water. In a deep fryer or a large pan, add enough oil so that the eggplant pieces will float. Heat on medium high, you'll know it's hot enough if you can add a drop of water and it sizzles. Remove several of the eggplant rounds and dry on a towel. Add them to the oil and fry until they are brown on both sides. Do not crowd the pan! Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel (or cloth towel) to absorb any excess oil. Continue until all of the eggplant has been fried. In a large frying pan, add all of the eggplants and 6-8 spoonfuls of the liquid from your cooking tajine. The eggplant will start to break down, add the vinegar at this point. Use a fork or wooden spoon to mash up the eggplant as it cooks. It should not be a liquid but more like a cooked salad. When the lamb has cooked through completely, and there is still some liquid remaining in the tajine, remove from the heat and add the eggplant to the top of the meat. Serve hot. This is usually eaten communally with plenty of bread to scoop up the meat and eggplant - don't forget an extra dip in the sauce before eating!",310

Place the lamb shanks in the middle of the tajine, as flat as possible. Arrange potatoes around the lamb chops. Cut the preserved lemon into several pieces and slip in and around the tajine, making sure some are sitting on the lamb.  Do the same thing with the garlic cloves. Finally, sprinkle the cumin, pepper, and turmeric all around the tajine. Chop up the parsley and cilantro and sprinkle all over the top of the tajine. Finally, pour the 2 tbsp of water over the top of the dish. Cover the tajine and place on the stovetop over low heat.  Leave it alone now. This took about 2 1/2 hours to cook all the way through. The lamb should be very tender, falling apart and the potatoes soft. During the cooking process you can check how things are coming along. Use a spoon to scoop up sauce that is forming at the bottom of the tajine and pour on top of the vegetables and meat.  This adds some extra flavor. Just before it's done, spread the peas around the tajine.  Some in the middle, around the edges – anywhere they will fit! Let it cook for about 10 more minutes before serving.",165
Moroccan Lamb and Fig Tagine,"2 lbs lamb pieces - 3 cloves crushed garlic (as fine as possible) - 1 1/2 tsp grated, fresh ginger - 1/2 tsp salt - 1/4 tsp white pepper - pinch of saffron threads, crushed - 1/2 tsp cinnamon - 2 tsp olive oil - small handful of cilantro - 10-12 Turkish dried figs - 1 Tbsp honey - 1 tsp cinnamon - 1 cup almonds - vegetable oil for frying","In the bottom of a pressure cooker, add olive oil. Rinse pieces of lamb and remove any excess fat. Add the lamb to pressure cooker and heat uncovered until it begins to brown. Add garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, saffron, and cilantro. Mix well. Cover the meat with enough water so that it's almost completely submerged. Close the pressure cooker and heat on low to medium heat for 45 minutes. While the meat is cooking boil the almonds in water for 5 minutes so that the skins become loose and can be removed. Drain the almonds and set aside. In a pot, add the figs and cinnamon and just enough water to cover the figs. Turn the heat to medium and allow to simmer. While you're waiting for the figs and meat, prepare the almonds. Squeeze the almond between your thumb and forefinger to remove the skins. Lay the almonds flat on a baking tray, and slide into a low over for 10-15 minutes. You do not want to cook the almonds, just to remove the excess liquid - this will help them fry better. After the meat has cooked for 45 minutes, release the pressure and check it. The lamb should be tender and falling apart. You should also have a thicker liquid remaining in the pot. If you have a lot of liquid keep the pan on the heat and cook it down. Scoop 3-4 Tbsp of liquid into the pot with the figs. The figs are ready when they are soft and can easily be torn apart. Once they are at this point, stir in 1 Tbsp of honey and adjust the liquid, adding more cinnamon if it's overly sweet. In a frying pan add a thin layer of vegetable oil and slowly fry the almonds until they just turn brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain any excess oil. Toss lightly with a little bit of salt. To arrange the tajine, place the meat in a large serving dish (like a tajine bottom) along with the liquid. Place the figs on top and drizzle the liquid from the figs all over the dish. Lastly, sprinkle the almonds on top. Eat by scooping up with crusty bread.",60
Lamb and Artichoke Tajine,1 1/2 - 2 lbs lamb or mutton - 1 medium onion sliced into rings - 2-3 artichokes cleaned - 1/2 preserved lemon cut into several pieces - 1 tsp olive oil - 2 tsp cumin - 2 tsp crushed or minced garlic - 1 tsp pepper - 1 tsp turmeric - 1/2 c water,"In a bowl whisk together olive oil, cumin, garlic, pepper and turmeric. In the bottom of a medium tajine add the artichokes and sliced onions to create a bed for the lamb. Clean and trim the pieces of lamb removing some of the fat (but not all!) Place the lamb on top of the onions and artichokes. Drizzle the lamb with the oil and spice mixture, rubbing the mixture into the meat. Place the pieces of preserved lemon around the tajine, slipping between the meat and vegetables. Add the 1/2 cup of water to the tajine. Do not pour directly on top of the meat but around the edges. Cover the tajine and place on the stovetop, making sure to use a diffuser if cooking on an electric burner. Cook for 1 hour on low-medium heat. Check by lifting the lid and using a spoon to pour the liquid on top of the meat. Add more water if needed. Cover and cook until the meat is tender and falling apart and the liquid in the tajine has reduced to a medium/thick sauce. Serve with a crusty bread and eat hot.",60
Moroccan White Beans (Loubia) Instant Pot Recipe,"1 cup dried, white cannellini beans - 5 garlic cloves (or more!) - 1 Tbsp cumin - ½ tsp salt - ¼ c olive oil - 1 Tbsp paprika - 1 hot pepper such as jalapeno or serrano (optional) - 2 cups water or broth (any type of broth)",Soak beans overnight in enough water to cover them completely as well as an inch or two additional as the liquid will absorb. When you are ready to cook In the instant pot add all of the ingredients and mix together.  Close the top and the valve. Set to pressure and cook for 40 minutes. You want a longer cooking time on these because of what the consistency of the beans should be.  The beans should be very soft and have a thick liquid remaining. If it is still watery turn the saute option on and reduce the liquid. You also may want to use a fork to mash some of the beans to create a thicker sauce. Serve as a main dish with bread to scoop it up or as a side dish.,45
An Easy Recipe for Moroccan Chickpeas (Hommos),1 1/2 cups (250 grams) dry chickpeas - 4 cloves garlic - 1/8 piece of a preserved lemon - 2 Tbsp cumin - pinch of saffron threads - 2-3 Tbsp olive oil - 1 Tbsp butter - 2 1/2 cups water,For this recipe you need to use dry chickpeas. These should be soaked overnight; at least 8 hours and ideally longer if possible. The longer you can soak them the faster they'll cook. Once the chickpeas are ready to be cooked Add everything to a pressure cooker and mix together. You don't need to do anything special or add in any certain order. I use olive oil and butter to just add a bit of flavor and richness but you can leave out the butter if you want. Put the cover on the pressure cooker and place on the stove at medium heat. Leave to cook for 1 hour. Release the steam and check the tenderness of the chickpeas. They should still have some firmness but you can cook as long as you'd like to get them to the softness you prefer. I serve this with some harissa on the side. It can be eaten as a side dish or main dish. We always eat it scooped up with bread.,780
Moroccan Lentil Instant Pot Recipe,1/4 c chopped onion - ¼ c olive oil - 1 cup brown lentils - 1 1/2 Tbsp cumin - 1 tsp turmeric - ½ tsp salt - 1 tsp garlic powder of 3 garlic cloves - 1 tsp pepper - 3-4 grated medium tomatoes or 200 mL crushed canned tomatoes - ¼ - ½ cup diced carrots (optional) - Whole hot pepper (optional),"Pour lentils into a large bowl and rinse well with cold water.  You can soak the lentils to reduce the cooking time. I suggest two hours up to overnight. Turn the instant pot on to saute. Add the olive oil and onions and allow to cook while mixing about 5 minutes. This will soften the onions.  Add the spices; cumin, turmeric, salt, garlic powder/cloves, pepper, saffron and mix to warm up the spices. Drain the excess water from the lentils and add to the instant pot. Mix in the tomatoes, carrots and 1 cup of water. You can also add the hot pepper if you’re planning to include it. Place the cover onto the instant pot. Adjust the valve to close. Select the pressure option and set timer to 20 minutes. When the timer goes off, allow to sit 5 minutes, release the steam valve and open. The lentils should be very soft and a thick sauce will remain. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as desired.",140
Slow Cooker Tajine with White Beans,2 tsp vegetable oil - a handful of Italian parsley finely chopped - 1 tsp chopped garlic - 1/2 tsp coriander - 1 tsp cumin - 1/4 tsp hot paprika - 1/2 of a preserved lemon - 1 tsp white pepper - 1/2 pound beef (bone-in or out your choice) - 2 cups white beans - soaked at least 6 hrs preferably overnight - 3 cups of water (enough to cover the beans and meat),"The directions are pretty straightforward - throw it all in the crockpot and cook on high for 3 hours or on low for about 6 hours. I would suggest cutting your meat into smaller pieces so that it cooks through more evenly and increases the flavor. If everything is cooked through and there is still a good bit of water left, pour the contents into a large pot on the stove and boil until the liquid is reduced. I like to smash some of the beans as well in the end and mix them through the liquid to thicken it.",365
Casablanca Fish Tajine,"one large handful of Italian parsley - 1 tsp kosher salt or sea salt - 2 minced garlic cloves - 2 tsp cumin - 1 tsp hot paprika - juice of 1 lemon - 1 lb thick, white fish such as cod, haddock, or halibut - 6 whole carrots peeled, and halved - 1 large tomato - 1 green pepper","If you have a mortar and pestle add the parsley, minced garlic, and sea salt to the mortar and break it down using the pestle. If you don't have this, simply add the ingredients to a bowl and use the back of a spoon to break them down. When you have broken down the parsley and garlic, add the cumin, hot paprika, and lemon juice. Stream in a little bit of water so that there is an easy to pour marinade. Clean your fish fillets, removing all of the skin from the fish. This may be difficult however you will not want the skin in the tajine. Coat the fish with the marinade and place on a plate or in a large bowl. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes - 2 hours. The longer you allow it to sit the more flavorful the fish will be. While you are waiting for the fish, begin to prepare the vegetables. Peel and cut the carrots into halves. Wash the tomato and slice horizontally into several thin slices, discard the top and stem. Wash and cut the top off of a green pepper. Scoop out the seed and cut horizontally into thin slices. Once the fish has marinated begin to prepare the tajine. I used an unglazed clay tajine. If you don't have a tajine you can use a heavy bottomed pot with a lid. Start by layering the carrots in the bottom of the vessel. Next add the fish, then the tomatoes, and finally the green peppers. Pour the rest of the marinade from the bowl on top of the tajine. Finally, add 1/4 cup of water around the outer edges. Turn the heat to low and cover the tajine. Leave untouched for 20-30 minutes. After this time, quickly uncover and check the water level. If it is low add a little more to the outer edges. If not, re-cover and leave alone for another 20 minutes. The tajine is done when the fish is flaking, the liquid has reduced to a thick sauce and the vegetables are soft to the touch.",365
Simple Sardine Meatball Tajine in Tomato Sauce,2 pounds fresh sardines (1 pound once cleaned) - 2 cloves garlic - 1 Tbsp cumin - 1 tsp paprika - Palmful each of chopped parsley and cilantro - Juice of 1 small lemon - Handful of short grain rice (optional) - 2 large tomatoes grated and skin discarded - Palmful each of cilantro and parsley chopped - 2 cloves of garlic crushed - 1 tsp cumin - 1 tsp paprika - 1/2 tsp salt - 2 Tbsp olive oil,"Before you start cooking it’s easiest to make the meatball mix first. You will want to ensure the sardines are as clean as possible; removing all bones and skin. It’s a bit easier to do this if you use larger fresh sardines. See the notes section on how to use tinned sardines instead. After the fish has been cleaned, add the meat, garlic, cumin, paprika, parsley, cilantro and lemon juice to a food processor. Turn on low power to combine all of the ingredients until it’s the consistency of a paste. If you are using the rice, mix it in at this point with a spoon.  Make the sardine paste into meatballs the size you’d like; typically they are slightly smaller than a golf ball. In the bottom of a tajine or in a skillet add the olive oil, garlic, and grated tomato flesh. Heat until it begins to bubble and add the remaining ingredients. Allow to cook on low heat.  Add the meatballs to the tomato sauce and cover the tajine or skillet. Allow to cook for 30-45 minutes on low heat until the meatballs are cooked all the way through.  Serve hot with bread for scooping up the dish. You can also prepare a roast green pepper (either bell pepper or hot pepper), remove the blackened part of the skin and then cut into thin ribbons to places on top of the sardines for an added flavor.

However you can make the vegetable portion of this and serve it with couscous that's been cooked in a rice cooker or a stove top method. In the bottom of the couscousierre, add the oil and turn the heat to medium. Begin by cooking the onions until they start to become translucent. Add in 10 cups of water, along with the tomato and spices; salt, pepper, turmeric, ginger as well as the cilantro and parsley bundle. Keep the heat on medium low. The first vegetables you will want to add are the hardest; sweet potato, turnip, squash etc as they need the longest cooking time. While these go in the pot complete the first steam of the couscous. Steaming Instructions for Couscous At the end of the first steam (approximately 20 minutes), fluff the couscous and prepare the second batch of vegetables. This would include the carrots, chickpeas, and cabbage. After the second steam (another 20 minutes) you'll add the remaining vegetables. I add the hot pepper at the end but if you want the heat to really get into your broth you can cook it in from the beginning. Finally the third steam (15-20 minutes) is complete and your couscous is ready to serve! Give the couscous a final fluff and put into a large serving dish. Make a small well in the middle and arrange the vegetables on top. Reserve the liquid, pouring some on the dish while the rest is served on the side for guests to use at their discretion.",90

In the bottom of the couscousierre, add the lamb, potato, sweet potato, carrots, parsnips, tomato, serano pepper, squash and onion. Add enough liquid (water or broth) to cover the vegetables. Mix in all of the spices, and drop in the parsley bouquet. Turn the stove on medium high heat until it boils, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Before steaming the couscous for the first time, spread the grains out in a large bowl and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of salt water. Separate the grains with your fingers as much as possible. You may need to add more water, they really should be quite damp but not dripping liquid. Transfer the couscous to the top of the couscousierre and turn the stove temperature to high. Cover the top of the pot with a lid and leave alone for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, check the grains. If they feel dry then remove and pour back into the bowl you originally used. Add more of the salt water and continue the process the same way you did the first time, taking care to separate the grains as much as possible. Just as with traditional couscous you will steam and wet the grains 3 times. Before the third steaming, add the zucchini and chickpeas to the bottom. At this time check the liquid levels and add more if it is getting low. When the final steaming is complete, remove the top of the couscousierre and dump the grains onto a large serving plate. Separate the grains as much as possible. Use a large slotted spoon to remove the meat and vegetables and arrange on top of the couscous. Pour 1/2 of the remaining liquid over the top of the dish. Place the remaining liquid into smaller bowls so that those eating can add extra liquid to their liking. Serve with large spoons for eating!",90

To prepare the topping Peel and cut all vegetables.  Separate vegetables by cooking time.  (i.e sweet potatoes will take longer to cook than green peas). In the bottom of the couscousiere add the chicken and the vegetables that will take the longest to cook, sweet potatoes, carrots, and onions. Add 4-5 cups of water, enough to cover the vegetables.  Add all of the spices and the bouquet garni. Turn the heat on medium high. Place the top of the couscousiere on the top of the pot and cover.  Allow to cook for 20-25 minutes. After 20 minutes check the couscous, all excess water should be cooked off and the grains should be starting to feel soft. Remove the top of the pot and pour into a large bowl.  In a separate bowl mix water and salt to make a salt water spritz.  Using your hand spritz the couscous with the saltwater. *the couscous will be very hot but the grains need to be separated* Use your hand and carefully roll the couscous to separate the grains as much as possible.  You can continue to spritz the couscous during this process. Once complete place back in the top of the couscousiere and back onto the heat, cover and allow 20 more minutes of steaming. After the second steaming add the quicker cooking vegetables to the bottom of the couscousiere (peas, zucchini, etc).  Check the water and add more if levels are low. There should be sauce left at the end. Spritz the couscous again after the second steaming, this time add smen while separating the grains.  (If you do not have smen you could use olive oil or regular butter or you do not have to add anything).  Steam the couscous for the final 20 minutes. In a large serving dish, pour out the couscous and make a well in the middle of the couscous. Using a slotted spoon remove the meat from the couscousiere and place into the well of couscous.

Couscous Tfaya Topping Recipe,8-10 medium onions sliced thinly - 1 cup raisins (yellow work best) - 1 cinnamon stick broke into several pieces - 1 tsp ginger - 1/2 tsp turmeric - 1/2 tsp salt - 2 Tbsp sugar - 4 Tbsp vegetable or unflavored oil,"Clean and slice onions into similar size strips. I cut the onion in half and then slice 1/2 circle slices. In a non-stick pan heat the oil to medium and add the onions to begin cooking. While the onions cook place the raisins in a bowl with just enough warm water to cover them to slightly rehydrate them. When the onions have started to soften, reduce the heat and add the spices; salt, turmeric, ginger and cinnamon. Continue cooking on low heat so that the onions get very soft and begin to caramelize slightly. After 20 minutes add the sugar (it can be reduced based on personal tastes) and the raisins. Cook an additional 10-15 minutes for the flavors to blend together and the raisins to soften as well.

Mint Chocolate Hot Cocoa Ball,Light Green Candy Melts - Chocolate Candy Melts - Pink Candy Melts - Yellow Candy Melts - 2 cups Hot Chocolate Mix - 2 cups Mini Marshmallows - Cactus Sprinkles,"Place each color of the candy melts in 4 separate microwave-safe bowls and melt in the microwave per the directions on the package. Place a small dollop of pink or yellow melted candy melt into the flower portions of the cactus molds. I find this easiest to do by placing the colorful chocolate into a zipper bag and use it to place my chocolate exactly where I’d like it. Do the same with the brown chocolate in the flower pot portion of the potted cacti molds. Using the green chocolate, add a tablespoon of light green chocolate to each mold, then using the bottom of your tablespoon spoon, press the chocolate up the sides of the mold, keeping it thick but even and filling the spaces up to the other colors (no need to go over the top of them, just don’t leave any holes). Place the chocolate filled molds into the freezer for 5 minutes. Remove molds from the freezer and gently peel the silicone mold away from the chocolate cactus cups, pulling the cactus cups out of the mold. I found this very difficult to do without breaking the arms off of the cacti if I did not put pressure on each arm equally while maneuvering the silicon mold away from the chocolate, so just keep that in mind and work slowly with even pressure. Place 1 tbsp melted light green candy melt into one cactus mold and, using the bottom of your tablespoon measuring spoon, move the chocolate around into a solid single layer over the bottom of the mold. Repeat until you have as many single layer chocolate molds made as you have made of the cactus chocolate cups. Place the chocolate filled molds into the freezer for 5 minutes. Fill the chocolate cactus cups with 1 tbsp hot chocolate mix, sprinkles if desired, and 6-8 mini marshmallows. Remove the molds from the freezer and gently peel the silicone mold away from the chocolate cactus bases, pulling the bases out of the mold. Pipe a thin line of melted candy melts around the rim of each filled cactus cup. Immediately press a cactus base to the top of one of the filled cups. This will close the hot cocoa bomb. Place the hot cocoa bombs into the freezer for 5 minutes to allow them to set, then remove. Pipe a small amount of melted pink and yellow chocolate in squiggly lines over the front of each pot, adding a small dab of chocolate in the corner and placing a cactus sprinkle on top. Place the hot cocoa bombs into the freezer for 5 minutes to allow them to set, then remove. Store in an airtight container until you’re ready to use. To use the hot cocoa bombs, place them in a mug and pour 2 cups hot milk over the top. Stir until the hot cocoa bombs are completely melted and enjoy!",55

Set aside. Make the cupcakes first by combining all of the dry ingredients in one bowl, whisking them together until combined completely. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and place the wet ingredients into the well then stirring until the batter is consistent and smooth. Fill the prepared cupcake liners ¾ full with the batter and bake for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool completely before decorating. To make the frosting, stir together the sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter and half and half over medium heat until it begins to boil and is completely combined. Remove the frosting mixture from the heat and add the vanilla extract. Stir until combined completely. Allow the frosting to cool before decorating the cupcakes with it. To make the cactus decorations, place the candy melts in separate microwave-safe bowls and melt per the package directions. Place melted candy melts into a piping bag with a small tip or a zipper-top bag with a tiny corner cut off. Into the mold, add stripes of light green candy melts following the shapes of the cactus or succulent, followed by dark green candy melts. Fill in any “pot” shapes with the dark blue candy melts. Place the chocolate filled molds into the freezer for 5 minutes to set. Remove the chocolate from the molds and set aside. Using a cupcake corer or a large icing tip, cut a hole in the center of each cupcake, then add 1 tbsp sprinkles to the hole created. Place the cupcake piece removed from the center of the cupcake back into the hole. Cover each cupcake with a thin layer of frosting, followed by a sprinkle of chocolate shavings. Top each cupcake with a chocolate cactus or succulent and enjoy!",25
Chebakia,"1/2 kg (about 4 cups) flour, plus additional if necessary - 1 soup bowl full (about 200 g or 7 oz.) of golden unhulled sesame seeds, toasted - 1 teaspoon ground anise - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled - 1/4 teaspoon Moroccan yellow colorant - pinch of Gum Arabic grains (gum acacia, mastic) – mix with 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and crush to a powder - 1 extra-large egg - 1/4 cup butter, melted - 1/4 cup olive oil - 1/4 cup vinegar - 1/4 cup orange flower water - 2 teaspoons yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water - ———————————————————————- - 1 1/2 kg (about 3 lbs.) honey - 2 tablespoons orange flower water - 1 1/2 liters vegetable oil, for frying - 1/2 cup golden unhulled sesame seeds, toasted, for decorating","Ahead of time, pick through the sesame seeds to remove any debris. Spread them on a baking pan and toast the sesame in a 400° F (200° C) oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sesame seeds are crunchy and nutty-flavored. Allow them to cool thoroughly, and then store in an airtight container until ready to use. Grind one bowlful of toasted sesame in a food processor until it turns powdery. Keep grinding until the powder becomes moist enough to press or pack. Mix the ground sesame with the flour and other dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix with your hands to form a dough. Add more flour if necessary to achieve a dough that is rather stiff but pliable. Knead the dough by hand for seven to eight minutes or in a mixer with dough hook for four to five minutes. Divide the dough into four portions, shape each into a smooth mound, and place the dough in a plastic bag to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.  Take one of the portions of dough, and roll it out to the thickness of a thin piece of cardboard. Lightly flour your work surface if necessary. Use a pastry cutter to cut the dough into rectangles approximately the size of your palm. Make four evenly spaced cuts lengthwise in each rectangle. These cuts should be almost the length of the rectangle, but should not cut through to the edges of the dough. The resulting rectangle will have five strips of attached dough.  Take a rectangle, and thread the middle finger of your right hand through alternating strips of dough. This enables the rectangle to drape over your finger. With your left hand, pinch together the outer corners of dough which hang over the tip of your finger. This will form the center of the flower shape. While holding the pinched corners with your left hand, allow the strips of dough to slide down off your right finger while gently turning them inside-out around the pinched portion. Gently pinch the opposite corners closed once the dough is turned inside out. If done correctly, you'll have formed the dough into an elongated flower shape.  Place the folded piece of dough on a baking sheet or tray. Repeat the process with the remaining rectangles and mounds of dough. Gather together the scraps of dough as you work, mold them together into a mound, and return them to the bag to rest before you try rolling them out again. Use up all of your dough in this manner. Cover the trays of folded dough with a towel until ready to fry.  Heat one inch of oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium heat. At the same time, heat the honey almost to a boil in a large pot. When the honey is frothy but not bubbling, add the orange flower water to the honey and turn off the heat.  When the oil is hot, cook the chebakia in batches. Adjust the heat as necessary to slowly fry each batch of chebakia to a medium brown color. This should take about 10 minutes if the oil is the correct temperature. If the oil is too hot, the chebakia will color quickly but the insides will not be cooked crispy.  When the chebakia are cooked to a medium golden brown, use a slotted spoon or strainer to transfer them from the oil directly to the hot honey. Gently push down on the chebakia to submerge them in the honey, and allow them to soak for 5 to 7 minutes. They'll turn a rich, glossy amber color as they absorb the honey. In the meantime, you can begin frying another batch of cookies. Note: The longer you soak the chebakia, the more honey they will absorb, and the sweeter and less crispy they become. How long to soak them is a matter of personal preference. However, too short of a soaking will result in pale-colored chebakia that eventually lose their glossy coating. When the chebakia have finished soaking, remove them from the honey to a strainer or colander, and allow them to drain for only a few minutes. Gently transfer them while hot to a large platter or tray, and sprinkle the centers with sesame. As you finish soaking other batches of chebakia in the honey, simply drain and add them to the platter in a mound, garnishing each batch with sesame.",90
Gluten Free Chebakia,1 1/4c almond flour - 1 1/2c rice flour + extra for dusting - 1 1/2c corn or tapioca starch - 1/2 tsp baking powder - 1/2 tsp salt - 1 1/2 tsp anise seeds - 1 tsp cinnamon - a pinch of saffron - a pinch of mastic + pinch of sugar - 1 egg - 1/4 c melted butter - 1/4 c olive oil - 1/4c  white vinegar - 3 Tbsp orange blossom water - 1 tsp yeast + 1/4c warm water + 1 tsp sugar - sesame seeds - vegetable oil - 2-3 cups honey,"In a large mixing bowl combine 1 1/4c almond flour, 1 1/2c rice flour, and 1 1/2c corn or tapioca starch along with baking powder, salt, anise seeds, cinnamon, and saffron. In a separate bowl, or ideally with a mortar and pestle, crush and blend the mastic and sugar. If you don't have a mortar and pestle you can use the back of a spoon to break it down. When you've formed a powder add this to the flour mixture. Prepare the yeast by adding 1/4c warm water and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Leave to activate 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, slowly add the butter, olive oil, vinegar and orange blossom water to the dry ingredients. Combine with a wooden spoon or your hands. Once the yeast has activated (bubbling) add it to the dough. The resulting dough will be a bit sticky, but should hold together in a large ball. Cover with a towel and set aside to rest for 15-20 minutes. On the stovetop begin to heat vegetable oil for frying the cookies. The oil should be deep enough to submerge the cookies. In another pot, add the honey and turn the heat to low. When the dough has completed the resting time, dust a cutting board or surface with rice flour and pinch off a piece off a palm-size piece of dough. With a rolling pin (or a glass!) roll out the dough to about 1/4"" thickness. Cut the dough into 1/2"" width strips using a ribboned pastry wheel. Alternately, you can cut with a pizza cutter you just won't get the fluted edges. Gently drop pieces of dough into the oil and fry until light brown in color. If you notice your cookies are falling apart in the oil, place the bowl in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes. If the dough gets too warm I found it tends to fall apart when cooked. Strain cookies with a slotted spoon after frying and place into the honey. Allow to sit in the honey for 30-45 seconds and then move to a drying rack or plate. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top of the cookies before they dry. Store in a sealed container, in the refrigerator. Cookies will keep for 1-2 weeks. You can also freeze them for longer storage time.",90
Gluten-Free Piped Moroccan Cookies,3 cups Gluten-Free Blend flour - 3/4 cup sugar - 1/2 tsp salt - 2 tsp xanthan gum - 1/2 cup vegetable oil - 3 eggs - 1 Tbsp vanilla - 1/4 cup whole milk - 1/2 cup dark or semi-sweet chocolate for dipping,"In the bowl of a stand mixer combine 3 cups gluten-free blend flour, 3/4 cup sugar, a 1/2 tsp salt, and 2 tsp xanthan gum. Mix using a paddle attachment. Crack 3 eggs into a bowl and slowly add to the flour. Stream in 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1 Tbsp vanilla. The cookie mix should be crumbly at this point. Slowly add the milk to bring together the mixture. The dough you will be left with should not be a liquid and should be soft enough to push through a cookie press. Either grease a cookie sheet or place a sheet of parchment paper down. Preheat your oven to 350F. If you have a piping bag with a fluted tip you can fill the bag and push out the cookies, about 2"" in length and 1/2"" in diameter. If not, add the dough to a ziploc bag and cut off one of the corners. You will then be able to squeeze the dough out of the bag. You won't have a pretty design but will get the shape. Pipe the cookies. They won't spread so you can place them somewhat close to each other. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 350F. You want them to become just a very light brown. Take care not to over bake them or they will be rock hard. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or carefully in the microwave if you're short on time. To melt in the microwave I place the chips in a bowl and heat for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each time, until the chocolate is completely melted. Dip each of the ends in chocolate and set on a piece of parchment to harden. Serve with Moroccan Mint Tea",27
"Gluten Free Strawberry, Lemon and Mint Tart","1/2 c white rice flour - 1/2 c sorghum flour - 1/2 c almond flour - 1 egg - 1/2 tsp salt - 2 tsp xanthan gum - 7 tbsp high quality unsalted cold butter cut into cubes - 5 tbsp cold water (more if needed) - 2/3 c lemon juice - 2/3 c sugar - 3 eggs + 1 egg yolk - zest of 1 lemon - 6 Tbsp unsalted, chilled butter - 6-7 large hulled strawberries - 3-4 springs of mint - 2 tsp sugar","This dough needs to be chilled before rolling out.  I make it first and let it chill at least 30-60 minutes. In a stand mixer, combine the flours, xanthan gum, and salt.  Start the mixer and add the butter until it looks like pebbles.  Continue mixing on low and add the egg and stream the cold water. Mix until the dough comes together. Shape into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator.  Pulse the cleaned and hulled strawberries, mint, and sugar into a food processor and blend until liquid. You can strain the sauce to remove some of the seeds. You will need full attention for this step.  In a bowl beat the eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and zest. Pour into a pot and turn burner to medium.  Add the butter and begin stirring. You must continue stirring until the butter melts and the cream firms up. It will seem like this step is taking a long time but the transition from a thin liquid to a thick consistency happens very suddenly so you must pay attention. Once it thickens remove it from the heat and set it aside.  Preheat an oven to 350F To make this tart you can use a tart pan or a pie pan.  Butter and flour whichever you are using before laying out the dough. Remove the tart dough from the refrigerator and unwrap.  Place a layer of plastic wrap on top of the dough and roll out.  The dough should be slightly larger than the pan. Lay dough on top of the pan and use your fingers to press the dough against the pan, removing any excess dough that is hanging off the edges.  Poke the crust with a fork. Slide the tart dough into the oven and pre-bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool partway. Pour the lemon cream into the crust and spread the strawberry-mint sauce on top of the lemon. Return to the oven and finish baking for 15 minutes. Remove and allow to cool completely before serving.  It is best when served cold. ",90

Soft Moroccan-style Cookies with Quince and Almonds,3 eggs - 1/2 cup vegetable oil - 1/2 cup melted butter - 1 cup granulated sugar - 1 teaspoon vanilla - 3 cups flour (approx.) - 2 teaspoons baking powder - 2 1/2 cups/625 g quince jam - 1 tablespoons water - 1 cup finely crushed almonds,"Preheat your oven to 350 F Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla until smooth and thick. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and stir or blend with your hands just long enough to form a soft dough that can be shaped into balls. If you feel the dough is too soft and sticky, work in a little more flour, but do not over mix, you want the dough to remain soft. You can shape the dough into any size ball you like. Go with a cherry size for smaller sandwich cookies or a walnut for larger single cookies. Place them on the baking sheet, allowing about an inch gap. Bake the cookies in batches in the middle of the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove to a rack to cool briefly—about 5 minutes before decorating. While the first batch of cookies is baking you can prepare the glaze. Transfer the crushed almonds to a plate If your quince jam has pieces of fruit in it, you have two choices. The first is to leave it as is but thin it down. The other is to blend it into a smooth consistency. Place the quince jam in a small saucepan and add a little bit of water to thin it out. Heat over medium heat for a few minutes and it is ready to use. For decorating you have two options. 1) Sandwich cookies. Dip the bottoms of the cookies in the glaze and then in the crushed almonds and sandwich together. 2) Topped cookies. Spoon a teaspoon of the jam to the top of the cookies and sprinkle with almonds.",47
Amlou Cookies,For the Amlou - - 1 cup of raw almonds - - 1-2 tbsp argan oil - - 2 tsp honey -  - For the Cookies - 1 cup white flour - 1 cup oat flour - 1/2 c powdered sugar - 2 tsp salt - 1 tbsp baking soda - 1 egg - 1/2 cup melted butter - flour or almond flour for dusting,"Making the Amlou Add all of your almonds to a food processor and start running. Leave it for about 4 minutes. The almonds will first break apart and look like flour, as they continue to break down they will start clumping up - don't worry let it keep running. They will then start to get creamy as the oil releases. After 4 minutes turn it off and open it up and check. You should have a paste similar to a thick peanut butter. Return the cover and drizzle in the argan oil to loosen up the paste. You may need to add a little more or less oil just depending on how your almonds broke down. Remove the paste from the food processor and mix in the honey. To Make the Cookies Sift flours, baking soda, salt and powdered sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add egg and melted butter.  Mix together gently using a whisk. You will not want to overwork it but just get it all together. The final product will be a ball that is a little wet.  Wrap up the ball with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.  The dough needs to be firm enough to roll out into a sheet. Once rested use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a large rectangle. I find this easiest to do by placing the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Sprinkle some flour on your work surface to keep the dough from sticking. Once all the dough is about 1/4"" thick use a spoon to spread a layer of amlou over the entire rectangle.  It will be a thin layer.  If you are finding that the amlou is not fluid enough to spread, add a little more argan to the amlou and mix. Once the amlou is down begin rolling the dough up into a large cylinder. Wrap as tightly as possible. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate another hour or longer. The dough should be firm enough to cut through without breaking apart. You may alternately decide to pop it into the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up. Preheat your oven to 350F. Remove dough from refrigerator and cut into slices between 1/4 and 1/2"" thick.  Try to make all cuts as uniform as possible. Lay flat to bake on a cookie sheet. These cookies will not spread much so you can place them near one another. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes until just starting to brown. Remove from the oven when they're just turning brown and place on a cooling rack.  The cookie will be similar to a shortbread in texture.",132

Traditional Moroccan Ghriba,8 cups all purpose flour (1 kg) - 2 cups powdered sugar (250g) - 1 cup toasted sesame seeds (150 g) - 2 tsp salt - 1 Tbsp orange blossom water - 1 Tbsp baking soda - 1 cup unflavored oil (like vegetable oil) - you may need more.," Gather all of your ingredients as well as a very large bowl or use your countertop as a work surface. This will make it a lot easier. Start by mixing the dry ingredients and forming a well in the middle of the mixture. Pour in the orange blossom water and 1/2 cup oil. Begin kneading the dough. You truly need to do this part by hand and it will take some time (approximately 10 minutes of kneading.)  Continue to add oil as you go until the dough sticks together when you press it into a ball. If it is still crumbly add more oil, a little at a time. You want the dough to feel slightly wet and oily to the touch but still be soft.  Leave the dough alone to rest for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 325F (160C). Clean the tray you will be using to bake your cookies and lightly grease to avoid sticking. If you are not using the special cookie, sheet prepare a large baking pan and line with parchment paper. Once the dough has rested take off pieces about the size of a ping pong ball (about 2 inches or 5cm across) and form into a small disc. The edges should not crack. If they do, re-roll the ball.  Place the discs onto the baking pan. If using the specialty pan for this the cookies will naturally form around the circle. If using a baking pan you can set them down as they are.  Continue until all of the dough has been used. Cookies should bake for about 20 minutes but it's important to watch. They should be cooked through but only a very light brown color. The tops will crack, so don't worry if you see this. After baking remove from the oven and allow to cool 5 minutes and transfer to a cooling rack to complete the cooling process. ",55
Moroccan Date cookies,1 1/3 cup (170g) frozen raspberries - 2 Tbsp brown sugar - 1/3 cup (80 g) heavy whipping cream (vegan option) - 7 oz  (140 g) white chocolate (vegan option) - 1 cup gluten-free oats - 10 pitted and halved Medjool dates - 1 Tbsp coconut oil - 10 oz (200 grams) dark chocolate (vegan) - 2.5 oz (50 grams) red chocolate chips - 2.5 oz (50 grams) white chocolate,"Place the frozen raspberries into a bowl and add a little bit of warm water to start thawing them. In the bowl of a food processor, add the gluten-free oats and run for a few seconds to create an oat powder. In a bowl, add the dates and pour hot water on top of them. Let them soak for 3-5 minutes until they are completely soft.  You may need more or less time depending on how soft your dates were to begin with.  Add the dates into the food processor with the oats Run the food processor until it forms a dough. (if the mixture is too dry, add some of the water that the dates were soaking in). Pour everything into a bowl and cover. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use. Drain the raspberries of any liquid that is gathered in the bowl and place them into the bowl of the food processor. Blend until it becomes liquid - similar to a smoothie.  Pour the liquid through a fine sieve into a small pot for the stovetop. Make sure to press down to extract all of the juice while leaving behind as many seeds as possible. Bring the liquid to medium-low heat. Mix in the whipping cream and heat the mixture for around 8-10 minutes. On another burner prepare a double boiler and melt the white chocolate. Once fully melted, mix it with the raspberry liquid and set it aside for about 30 minutes, until it cools down. You do not need to put it in the refrigerator or freezer. Take the oat and date dough and place it in between 2 sheets of parchment paper.  With the help of a rolling pin, flatten the dough to 1/2 inch in thickness.

In a bowl add the chopped, cooked shrimp, olives, noodles, spices and cilantro and mix well so that the spices combine with everything.  The next step is to stuff and seal the briouats. Lay phyllo or egg roll diagonally with the point facing you.  Fill with 1-2 tbsp of noodle and shrimp mixture. To roll them, fold over the triangle and roll a 1/2 turn.  Fold in the edges and continue rolling.  These will make an eggroll shape.  As you tuck the last roll, brush some egg wash onto the end piece to seal the briouat. Lay in a flat layer on a cookie sheet.  These can be partially baked (at 375F) and frozen - to be re-heated when ready to eat. Or they can be deep fried (if using an egg roll wrapper this is a better option). Serve hot!  ",40

Add the spices and egg, mixing well. Begin to add the flour slowly, mixing while you go. The dough should be slightly sticky but should not stick to your hands. You may need to add more than the 1/2 cup of flour.  Heat the oil to medium. Begin making small balls with the potato mixture. The size is really up to you. Flatten each ball and dust with flour.  Add the patties to the oil, making sure not to crowd the pan. Brown on both sides, remove from oil and drain on a paper towel. Eat warm with your favorite condiment (harissa is tasty!) or make into a sandwich. Traditionally the ma'akouda sandwich is made on a baguette stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, olives, spicy Moroccan mustard and mayo.",25

In a food processor add all of the above plus the almonds, tarragon, salt and basil and pulse until broken down. You can blend them until they are completely broken apart or leave in larger chunks. Pour the ground matzo into a large bowl. Combine the mixture from the food processor to the matzo and stir to incorporate. Break the egg and mix it into the stuffing. Cut the 1/2 stick of butter into small cubes and gently mix with the stuffing. Place the chicken into a roasting pan. If you don't have a roasting pan, I found that using a large oven proof pot works just as well. Gently separate the skin of the chicken from the flesh. Begin stuffing by adding a layer of stuffing between the skin and flesh. Smooth out as much as possible. Do this in as many places as possible. Add the remaining stuffing to the interior cavity of the chicken. Pour the 3/4 cup of chicken broth into the pot/pan. Slide the pot/pan into the preheated oven and bake for 60-90 minutes. The baking time is going to depend on how large your chicken is. You want the juice to run clear and for there to be no pinkness in the meat. The outside of the skin should be brown and crisp and the interior juicy. Serve hot with a side salad and/or potatoes.",95

Roasted Chicken with Moroccan 6 Spices,1 whole free range chicken - juice of 1 lemon + zest 1/2 lemon - 1 teaspoon paprika - 2 tsp cumin - 2 tsp garlic powder - 1/2 tsp turmeric - 1 tsp salt - 1/2 tsp pepper - 2-3 tsp olive oil," Clean chicken well and remove skin.  I use paper towels to dry off the outside of the chicken and the cavity.  Too much liquid causes the marinade to drip off. Add lemon juice to spice mixture and stir.  Slowly add olive oil.  You may not need the full amount (depending on how much juice your lemons yielded).  Your mixture should be a loose paste.  Cover chicken with marinade, making sure to get all areas of the chicken covered.  Any remaining marinade can be used to rub inside of the cavity. Insert the lemon rinds into the cavity of the chicken.  This will help it keep its shape and also infuse flavor. At this point the chicken can; a) marinade in the fridge for between 30 minutes - overnight or b) go straight into a preheated 375F oven for 2-2.5 hours. The outside should be a golden color when cooked through.I also make a sauce reduction using the drippings from the pan and 1 cup of chicken broth in a sauce pan. Flavor with some more of the 6 spice mixture. Cook on medium high until it reduces to a thick sauce.  You could also add some cornstarch in the beginning to thicken and ensure you have enough sauce. Olives can also be added to the sauce mixture.",165

Place on a towel to suck out as much additional moisture as possible. If you are using fresh artichokes. Wash and rinse. Place whole artichokes into the top of a double boiler. Allow to steam for about 20-25 minutes. Cool and remove the outer leaves until you get to the artichoke heart. Remove the fuzz leaving just the bottom. Set aside.  In a bowl mix the ground turkey, oil, chopped onions, finely chopped parsley and cilantro, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix really well so that everything is combined. Add 1 Tbsp of matzo meal at a time to thicken the mixture. Roll into balls that are a bit smaller than your artichoke bottoms. Set aside. Whisk eggs in a shallow bowl. Add the 1/4 cup crushed matzo meal or crackers to a different shallow bowl or plate. In a large skillet heat 1/4c vegetable oil on medium heat.  Place one of the meatballs on the top of the artichoke heart and press down slightly. Coat with the eggwash and coat with the crushed matzo. Transfer to the heated oil with the meat side down. Cook on both sides until browned about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking dish. If you have more meatballs than artichokes you can coat the meatballs with the egg and matzo mix and fry the same as the artichokes. Crush 1 tsp of saffron between your fingers and put in a small bowl. Top with 1/4c boiling water. In a separate bowl whisk together oil, pepper, salt, and 1/2c lemon juice. Add 1 tsp honey. Add in the hot saffron water and mix until well combined.  In the baking dish arrange the artichokes and meatballs. Sprinkle in the peas around the emty spaces of the dish. Pour the lemon saffron sauce over the top (try to avoid directly pouring on the meat but around the open edges. Place into the oven and bake at 175C/355F about 30 minutes until the sauce is thickens a bit. Garnish with lemon slices to serve! ",50
